Description: Wrapper to select between Qt development binary versions
 Qt is a cross-platform C++ application framework. Qt's primary feature
 is its rich set of widgets that provide standard GUI functionality.
 .
 The Qt Chooser provides a wrapper to switch between versions of Qt 
 development binaries when multiple versions like 4 and 5 are installed 
 or local Qt builds are to be used.
 .
 If you wish to use Qt development binaries with the default PATH and 
 without special parameters, you need to additionally install either 
 qt4-default or qt5-default package to provide the default configuration.
