qtchooser (26-3) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Pino Toscano ]
  * Add Vcs-Git and Vcs-Browser headers.
  * Append the CPPFLAGS to the CXXFLAGS, as qtchooser's build system uses only
    the latter.
  * Export the LDFLAGS as LFLAGS, as qtchooser's build system uses only the
    latter.
  * Drop the own copy of qtchooser.1 and use the upstream version.

  [ Lisandro Damián Nicanor Pérez Meyer ]
  * Add a three possible paths for configs. In this way:
    - We can add arch-triplet qualified configs.
    - We can install arch-specific configs.
    - We avoid FTBFS of Qt4 packages already in the archive without the need to
      patch debhelper for this.
    - Tools like qdbus will fallback to the Qt4 version even if qt4-default is
      not installed.
    Apps wanting to use Qt5's qdbus should explicitly call it with -qt=qt5.
