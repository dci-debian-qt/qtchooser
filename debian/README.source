= Bootstrapping qtchooser.

qtchooser build-depends on libqt4-dev (and it can also be built with qt5).
But as of Qt 4:4.8.4, you need qtchooser to run qmake.

Actually qtchooser only needs Qt4 for building it's tests. If you need to
bootstrap it, simply remove libqt4-dev as build dependency and override
dh_auto_test in debian/rules.
