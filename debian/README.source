= Bootstrapping qtchooser.

qtchooser build-depends on qtbase5-dev, but qtchooser itself it's needed
in order to run qmake, so creating a circular build dependency.

Actually qtchooser only needs Qt5 for building it's tests. If you need to
bootstrap it, simply remove qtbase5-dev as a build dependency and override
dh_auto_test in debian/rules or add nocheck to DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.
